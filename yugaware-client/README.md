# yugaware-client

`yugaware-client` configures yugaware

This project uses an ALPHA version of an generated open-api swagger, and is not guaranteed to work. Currently, it is only tested on v2.9.0 of yugaware.

This client library should be considered `UNSTABLE`, and will likely change significantly.
